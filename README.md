# MadLib_Fun
#Life can be stressful but playing a childhood game always relieves the stress and reminds me of a simpler time. I used to love doing mad libs. It is so funny to read the story after filling in the adjectives, adverbs, nouns or pronouns. The mad libs game would mainly use the input command along with Boolean strings to create the Mad lib. Mad libs do not have a winner or loser. Mad libs creates funny stories based on the usersâ€™ inputs.   
#Here is a sample code website that talks about this project: https://teachwithict.weebly.com/python-mad-libs.html
